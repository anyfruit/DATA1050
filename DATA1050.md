Types of data
- numerical, textual, graphic, audio, video
- streaming, real-time
- geo-spatial, temporal
- structured, semi-structured, unstructured
- transactional, log data
- sensor data, machine data
- other

#### 4 Types of Data
1. nominal - cannot be ordered or ranked; it represents distinct categories or names
   1. Eye color: blue, brown, green, hazel
   2. Car brand: Toyota, Ford, Honda
   3. Types of fruits: apple, banana, orange

4. continuous - take any value within a range and can be measured to any level of precision

#### Structured and Unstructured Data
- Metadata for unstructured data is basically useless
- Unstructured:
  - Example: documents, videos, images, soundtracks
  - Newspaper, videos, images themselves can't bring a lot information

#### Big Data
- Volume
- Velocity
- Variety

#### Data Models
Consists of:
1. Data representation (tuples, objects, graphs, ...)
2. Query language (e.g. SQL)
3. Constraints that provide semantics for data (e.g. integrity constraints)

#### Types of Data Storage
- Persistent vs. volatile
  - Persistent is in harddrive storage, and volatile in memory
- Types of persistent storage
  - files
  - databases
  - spreadsheets
- Types of volative storage
  - data structure (trees, graphs, etc.)
- volatile to persistent(e.g. pickling)
- persistent to volatile

##### Relations
- A relation is a set of tuples
- Terminology:
  - Database: set of names relations
  - Relation: has two components
    - 1. Schema (metadata)
    - 2. Instance (data)
  - Attribute: unique columns of the data
  - Tuple: row of data
